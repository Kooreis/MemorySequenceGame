# Memory Game in Python

This Python script is a simple memory game. The game generates a sequence of random numbers based on the difficulty level chosen by the user. The user then has to remember and input the sequence correctly to win the game.

## Libraries Used

- `random`: This library is used to generate random numbers. In this script, it is used to generate the sequence of random numbers that the user has to remember.

- `time`: This library is used for time-related tasks. In this script, it is used to create a delay before the sequence of numbers is cleared from the screen.

## Functions

- `generate_sequence(difficulty)`: This function generates a sequence of random numbers. The length of the sequence is determined by the difficulty level chosen by the user.

- `get_list_from_user(difficulty)`: This function prompts the user to input the sequence of numbers they remember. The number of inputs is determined by the difficulty level.

- `is_list_equal(list_a, list_b)`: This function checks if two lists are equal. In this script, it is used to check if the sequence inputted by the user matches the generated sequence.

- `play(difficulty)`: This function runs the game. It generates the sequence, clears the screen after a delay, gets the user's input, and checks if the user's input matches the generated sequence.

- `main()`: This is the main function that runs when the script is executed. It prompts the user to choose a difficulty level and runs the game.

## How to Run

To run the game, simply execute the script in a Python environment. You will be prompted to choose a difficulty level. After choosing a difficulty level, a sequence of numbers will be displayed. Remember the sequence and input it when prompted. If your input matches the sequence, you win the game. If not, you lose.

# Memory Sequence Game

This is a simple console-based memory sequence game implemented in C#. The game generates a random sequence of numbers between 1 and 4, and the player's task is to remember and input the sequence correctly. The sequence gets longer after each successful round, and the game continues until the player makes a mistake.

## Script Explanation

The script starts by importing necessary libraries:

- `System`: This namespace contains fundamental classes and base classes that define commonly-used value and reference data types, events and event handlers, interfaces, attributes, and processing exceptions.
- `System.Collections.Generic`: This namespace contains interfaces and classes that define generic collections, which allow users to create strongly typed collections that provide better type safety and performance than non-generic strongly typed collections.
- `System.Linq`: This namespace provides classes and interfaces that support queries that use Language-Integrated Query (LINQ).
- `System.Threading`: This namespace provides classes and interfaces that enable multithreaded programming. In this script, it is used to pause the execution of the program for a certain period.

The script defines a `Main` method inside the `Program` class, which is the entry point of the application. Inside the `Main` method, the script does the following:

- Initializes an empty list `sequence` to store the sequence of numbers.
- Initializes a `Random` object to generate random numbers.
- Initializes a `score` variable to keep track of the player's score.
- Enters an infinite loop where the game logic is executed. The loop does the following:
  - Adds a random number between 1 and 4 to the sequence.
  - Displays each number in the sequence to the player, pausing for a second between each number and clearing the console afterwards.
  - Prompts the player to input the sequence. If the player's input does not match the sequence, the game ends and the player's score is displayed. If the player's input matches the sequence, the score is incremented and the console is cleared for the next round.

## How to Run

To run the script, you need a .NET environment. You can compile and run the script using the `dotnet run` command.

# Memory Sequence Game

This is a simple Java script for a memory sequence game. The game works by showing the player a sequence of colors one by one. After each round, the player is required to remember and input the sequence of colors in the correct order. If the player inputs the correct sequence, they proceed to the next round where an additional color is added to the sequence. The game continues until the player inputs the wrong sequence, at which point the game ends.

## Code Explanation

The script uses the following Java libraries:

- `java.util.ArrayList`: This library provides resizable-array and implements the List interface. It is used in this script to store the sequence of colors that the player needs to remember.

- `java.util.Arrays`: This library provides static methods to manipulate arrays. It is used in this script to convert an array of colors into a List.

- `java.util.Collections`: This library provides methods to manipulate collections and maps. However, in this script, it is imported but not used.

- `java.util.List`: This library provides a way to store ordered collections, also known as sequences. It is used in this script to store the sequence of colors.

- `java.util.Scanner`: This library provides methods to read input from various sources (like console input, file, etc.). In this script, it is used to read the player's input from the console.

The game starts by initializing a list of colors and an empty game sequence. Then, it enters an infinite loop representing the game rounds. In each round, a random color is added to the game sequence. The sequence is then displayed to the player one color at a time, with a delay of one second between each color. After displaying the sequence, the console is cleared and the player is asked to input the sequence. If the player's input matches the game sequence, the game proceeds to the next round. If the player's input does not match the game sequence, the game ends and the player's final round is displayed.
